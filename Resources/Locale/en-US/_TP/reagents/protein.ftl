reagent-name-activated-protein = activated protein
reagent-desc-activated-protein = Re-activated proteins. have a natural healing effect, but you should really specialise them for it to be useful

reagent-name-stabilisation-protein = stabilisation protein
reagent-desc-stabilisation-protein = A protein mix designed to stabilise cellular abnormalities

reagent-name-hyper-platelet = hyper-platelet
reagent-desc-hyper-platelet = Specialised platelet cells designed to function far quicker than typical. Different temperatures bring out differing effects

reagent-name-hyper-marrow = hyper-marrow
reagent-desc-hyper-marrow = Specialised bone marrow designed to assist with healing burns and bruises of any kind. Different temperatures bring out differing effects

reagent-name-destabilized-protien = destabilized protein
reagent-desc-destabilized-protein = Formed when hyper-platelets and hyper-marrow mix in ones bloodstream

reagent-name-denatured = denatured proteins
reagent-desc-denatured = Proteins cooked by high heat. Parts of this are potentially salvageable

reagent-name-dormant-protein = dormant protein
reagent-desc-dormant-protein = Dormant proteins removed from a denatured mixture

reagent-name-decayed-protein = decayed protein
reagent-desc-decayed-protein = Useless, centrifuge it for parts

reagent-name-exotic-protein = exotic protein
reagent-desc-exotic-protein = Activated proteins augmented by exotic extract. can be used for a wide variety of different effects

reagent-name-oxygenated-saline = oxygenated saline
reagent-desc-oxygenated-saline = A saline solution mixed with hyper-oxygenated proteins. Dexalin? Whats that?
